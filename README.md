# ν2HDM-to-νSMEFT

Ancillary files for [arXiv number] about matching ν2HDM onto νSMEFT at one-loop level via functional technique, by [authors]. This repository includes
- one-loop matching in different sectors, in *STr-tree.wl*, *H2-Log.wl*, *H2.wl*, *H2-H1.wl*, *H2-Fer.wl*, *H2-Vec.wl*, *H2-H1-Vec.wl*, *H2-H1-Fer.wl*, *H2-Fer-Vec.wl*, and *H2-H1-Vec-Fer.wl*.
- one-loop evanescent effects, in *Evanescent_νR.wl*, *Evanescent_ER.wl*, *Evanescent_UR.wl*, and *Evanescent_DR.wl*.

The matching is under NDR and modified MS schemes up to dimension six. The overall results of Wilson coefficients are provided in *Wilson.wl*, and they are at the heavy scale.
